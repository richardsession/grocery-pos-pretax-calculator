## Doing Better

In order to have a better OOP experience with JS, I would have developed this in TypeScript but decided to use vanilla JS along with Babel.

Thought about using decorators to handle some of the validation of the class properties. There were limitations with several validation libraries that I used including the one that is integrated into this application.
